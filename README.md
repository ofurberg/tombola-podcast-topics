# tombola-podcast-topics
Check if a topic has been covered on the Tombola Podcast

## How it works
Grabs all the episode names of the podcast from the podcast's iTunes page. Then allows the user to search for topics using a command line UI. Currently only works on Windows since the executable file was created with PyInstaller. If you want to use the program on an other OS you have to run the PyInstaller from that OS :/

## How to use
* Clone the repo and run the executable file located at "release-v1.0\dist\tombola-topics-finder\tombola-topics-finder.exe
